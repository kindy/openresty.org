This is an [Nginx](Nginx) module that uses libiconv to convert characters of different encoding. It brings the `set_iconv` and `iconv_filter` commands to [Nginx](Nginx).

It can either process Nginx variables or process response bodies as an output filter.

This module is not enabled by default, and you need to specify the `--with-http_iconv_module` option while [building OpenResty](Installation). This Nginx module requires libiconv to be installed into your system.
