# Donate With PayPal

If you'd like to make a one-time donation to OpenResty, you can use PayPal to make it fast and easy.

* PayPal members can donate directly from their PayPal accounts by logging in via the PayPal website and clicking "send money" to `agentzh@gmail.com`, or just click the button below.
* Non-PayPal members can still pay with a credit card without signing up for PayPal. Click the button below then follow the instructions at the bottom of the page for non-PayPal members.

# Donate with AliPay (支付宝)

If you're in China, it's usually more convenient to send donation is to send money via the [AliPay](http://www.alipay.com/) to my account `agentzh@yahoo.cn` or just click the following button:
