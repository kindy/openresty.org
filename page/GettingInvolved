The OpenResty project has a loose organization. Most of the components are self-contained open-source projects and are developed separately. They all have their own code repositories, their own test suites, or even their own maintainers. The maintainer of the OpenResty bundle, [agentzh](YichunZhang), is also maintaining most of the components included.

The [ngx_openresty GitHub repository](https://github.com/agentzh/ngx_openresty/) only contains the facilities to generate a tarball from all the components' releases for the bundle itself.

You can contribute patches or report bugs to each of the component separately. Please check out the [Components](Components) page for more details about each component project.

For example, one of the core components, LuaNginxModule, has its official code repository hosted on GitHub as well: https://github.com/chaoslawful/lua-nginx-module

Another core component, the Nginx core, is developed by the [Nginx company](http://nginx.com). And the opensource development of the Nginx core usually happens on the official [nginx-devel mailing list](http://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx-devel). But also keep in mind that the OpenResty bundle also maintains [a set of small patches](https://github.com/agentzh/ngx_openresty/tree/master/patches/) for the Nginx core to fix some urgent bugs or add a few really important features that must reside in the core.

Discussions not specific to the Nginx core should happen on the [openresty-en mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/openresty-en) (or the [openresty Chinese mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/openresty)). See the [Community](Community) page for more details. You are always welcome to join us there.

The maintainer of the OpenResty bundle periodically runs a big test cluster on [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) where the test suite of each component bundled is run against the latest Nginx releases. You can always check out the test reports on the [qa.openresty.org site](http://qa.openresty.org).
