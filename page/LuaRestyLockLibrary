This Lua library implements a simple nonblocking mutex lock API based on LuaNginxModule's shared memory dictionaries. Mostly useful for eliminating "dog-pile effects".

This library is enabled by default. You can specify the `--without-lua_resty_lock` option to OpenResty's `./configure` script to explicitly disable it.
