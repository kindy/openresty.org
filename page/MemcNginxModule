This module extends the standard memcached module  to support almost the whole memcached ascii protocol.

It allows you to define a custom REST interface to your memcached servers or access memcached in a very efficient way from within the nginx server by means of subrequests or independent fake requests.

When used in conjunction with [LuaNginxModule](LuaNginxModule), it is recommended to use [LuaRestyMemcachedLibrary](LuaRestyMemcachedLibrary) instead of this one, since it is more flexible and more memory-efficient.
