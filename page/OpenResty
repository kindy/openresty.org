~OpenResty (aka. ngx_openresty) is a full-fledged web application server by bundling the standard [Nginx](Nginx) core, lots of [3rd-party Nginx modules](http://wiki.nginx.org/3rdPartyModules), as well as most of their external dependencies.

By taking advantage of various well-designed Nginx modules, ~OpenResty effectively turns the nginx server into a powerful web app server, in which the web developers can use the Lua programming language to script various existing nginx C modules and Lua modules and construct extremely high-performance web applications that is capable to handle 10K+ connections.

~OpenResty aims to run your server-side web app completely in the Nginx server, leveraging Nginx's event model to do non-blocking I/O not only with the HTTP clients, but also with remote backends like ~MySQL, ~PostgreSQL, Memcached, and Redis.

~OpenResty is //not// an Nginx fork. It is just a software bundle. Most of the patches applied to the Nginx core in ~OpenResty have already been submitted to the official Nginx team and most of the patches submitted have also been accepted. We are trying hard //not// to fork Nginx and always to use the latest best Nginx core from the official Nginx team.
