This is an [Nginx](Nginx) upstream module that makes nginx talk to a redis 2.x server in a non-blocking way. The full Redis 2.0 unified protocol has been implemented including the redis pipelining support.

This module returns the raw TCP response from the Redis server.

This module is enabled by default and can be disabled by passing the `--without-http_redis2_module` option to the `./configure` script for OpenResty.

When used in conjunction with [LuaNginxModule](LuaNginxModule), it is recommended to use [LuaRestyRedisLibrary](LuaRestyRedisLibrary) module instead of this one, since it is more flexible and more memory-efficient.
