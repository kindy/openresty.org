This is an [Nginx](Nginx) upstream module that makes nginx talk to a redis 2.x server in a non-blocking way. It has a similar interface with the standard [ngx_memcached module](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpMemcachedModule), but only Redis `GET` and `SELECT` commands are supported.

This module returns the decoded result from the Redis server.

This module is written by Sergey A. Osokin.

This module is enabled by default and can be disabled by passing the `--without-http_redis_module` option to the `./configure` script for OpenResty.

When used in conjunction with [LuaNginxModule](LuaNginxModule), it is recommended to use [LuaRestyRedisLibrary](LuaRestyRedisLibrary) instead of this one, since it is more flexible and more memory-efficient.
